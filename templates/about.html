  <h1>About This Demo</h1>
  <div>
    <p>While I do work for MINDBODY, this project was written entirely outside of my day job.  The code may not fit all convensions and proven patterns, as it was a learning project for me as much as it was a demonstration for any who might find it useful.  If someone out there is a Django pro with a MINDBODY API account, please feel free to improve on it and send pull requests.</p>
    <p>This demo site uses <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django 1.8 </a> as the web framework, and <a a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/">Python 3</a> as the base language.  </p>
    <p>The project's source code can be found <strong><a href="https://github.com/vacoj/mbodjangodemo">here</a></strong>, and the work is free for just about any use.  Please read the details of the <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT License</a> to learn more.</p>
    <p>The original HTML/CSS template used for this site, entitled Progressus, was obtained from <a href="http://www.gettemplate.com/demo/progressus/"> gettemplate</a> - kudos to the designer.  It has been modified by me to fit the needs of this project, and is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons 3.0</a>.</p>
    <p>Finally, to actually make any use of this project, you're going to need to have access to the <a href="https://developers.mindbodyonline.com">MINDBODY SOAP API</a>.  Once signed up, using this project is as easy as plugging your source credentials into the right place.</p>
